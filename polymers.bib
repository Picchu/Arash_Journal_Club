  abstract="Conjugated polymer chains have many degrees of conformational freedom and interact weakly with each other, resulting in complex microstructures in the solid state. Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials."

A description of new classes of polymers being considered for gas separations, largely to overcome existing challenges or access applications that are not yet practiced commercially, is also provided. Some classes of polymers discussed in this review that have been the focus of much recent work include thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), perfluoropolymers, and high-performance polyimides.

In this study, we investigate the membrane fouling behavior in forward osmosis under conditions simulating the osmotic dilution process and the use of hydrodynamic methods without the use of cleaning chemicals, to control membrane fouling. Fouling runs with seawater or \{SWRO\} brine draw solution and deionized (DI) water feed solution showed insignificant water flux decline, which implies negligible effect of particulate and organic matter in the seawater/brine on fouling of the \{FO\} membrane support layer. Fouling of the membrane active layer was evaluated by using an enriched synthetic wastewater effluent containing a mixture of inorganic and organic foulants, focusing on the impact of permeate drag force on fouling layer formation. Our results demonstrate that higher permeate water flux causes an increase in concentration build-up of foulants at the membrane surface, thereby forming a dense inorganic/organic combined fouling layer during \{FO\} fouling runs. We also examined three hydrodynamic methods for minimizing \{FO\} membrane fouling in the osmotic dilution process: (1) applying shear force on the membrane surface by increasing the cross-flow velocity, (2) using a feed-channel spacer to induce turbulence, and (3) employing pulsed flow to remove foulants from the membrane surface. Our results show that these hydrodynamic methods substantially reduce fouling and flux decline rate. "

Whereas true phases (like the affine deformations of rubber) are homogeneous, the alternatives are inhomogeneous. In terms of the thermodynamics of solids, both classes of states must generally be given equal consideration."

We highlight the occurrence of a transition upon narrowing the gap, which arises from a cooperative simultaneous increase of the local density and degree of polymerization. At this transition, many properties of the confined solution, including the disjoining potential, change by orders of magnitude over a minute change of the surface separation. These results were obtained owing to two extensions to a previously introduced self-consistent field?propagator formalism. (i) We derive this formalism from a free-energy functional of the distribution of chain lengths and configurations. This enables evaluation of thermodynamic properties, including the disjoining potential. (ii) We solved for a system confined between two surfaces."

One of the most promising means of separating the hazardous \{CO2\} gas is to develop a cost effective and high-performance \{CO2\} separation membrane. From the wide range of membrane materials available, mixed matrix membrane (MMM) technology has shown the most promising results. In this study, \{MMMs\} were synthesized from cellulose acetate (CA) with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using the wet phase inversion technique. The results shown that \{MMMs\} with functionalized \{MWCNTs\} (MWCNTs-F) demonstrated the enhance permeance and selectivity towards the separation of CO2/nitrogen (N2). Thus, different loadings of MWCNTs-F into \{MMM\} were further investigated to interpret the physical morphologies and functionalities of MMMs, which enable the separation of CO2/N2 in a specific manner. Gas permeation measurements showed excellent \{MMM\} performances in terms of permeance and selectivity at 0.1&#xa0;wt% loadings of MWCNTs-F. This superior performance was due to the homogeneous dispersion between the MWCNTs-F and the \{CA\} matrix, which increased the sufficient free volumes between the polymer chains and enlarged the polymer/nanofiller interface, as confirmed by the X-ray diffraction results.

These \{PEEK\} polymers are suitable for producing phase inversion membranes as they are soluble in polar aprotic solvents, thanks to the presence of alkyl side groups. Firstly, the influence of polymer concentration on membrane performance was investigated and a volatile co-solvent was added to improve the retention. Evaporation time was then tuned, in addition to coagulation bath composition and casting thickness. The membranes were also tested with a smaller solute. Additional to this phase inversion study, stability of the membranes in alkaline conditions was investigated. The prepared polymers proved to have potential as solvent resistant nanofiltration membranes or as hydrophobic support materials for thin film composite membranes. "

The proposed approach integrated the knowledge about separation process, as attained at different lengths and timescales. The fouling progress, as determined by protein layers deposited on the membrane surface, and the permeate flux decay of dead-end ultrafiltration were predicted without resorting to adjustable parameters. With reference to Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) the electrostatic surface charges were calculated by accurate quantum mechanics approaches, along with the contact molecular surface and the \{BSA\} effective diameter. These quantities were exploited to estimate the \{BSA\} surface potential necessary to formulate, at a microscopic scale, a balance of the forces acting on each \{BSA\} particle. The additional resistance due to the accumulated protein layers was then calculated, thus allowing the transition to a macroscopic scale. A transport model describing the unsteady-state mass transfer of \{BSA\} was eventually formulated to predict the behavior of dead-end \{UF\} process as a function of the operating conditions. The predictions of the proposed multi-scale model were compared with a set of experimental data collected filtering a \{BSA\} aqueous solution through a polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane. "

Chemical crosslinking with amines provides the membranes with robust solvent stability. In this research, three types of modified \{PEEK\} were synthesized. All were crosslinked with both the well-known difunctional crosslinker hexanediamine as with the multifunctional polyallylamine. Performance of membranes prepared with both crosslinkers was compared for rose Bengal solutions in \{IPA\} and acetone, and for sunflower oil dissolved in acetone. Using polyallylamine as a crosslinker introduced free amines into the membrane structure, increasing the hydrophilicity of the membrane which improved the retention of edible oil significantly. "
