abstract = "Over the past three decades, polymeric gas separation membranes have become widely used for a variety of industrial gas separations applications. This review presents the fundamental scientific principles underpinning the operation of polymers for gas separations, including the solution-diffusion model and various structure/property relations, describes membrane fabrication technology, describes polymers believed to be used commercially for gas separations, and discusses some challenges associated with membrane materials development. A description of new classes of polymers being considered for gas separations, largely to overcome existing challenges or access applications that are not yet practiced commercially, is also provided. Some classes of polymers discussed in this review that have been the focus of much recent work include thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs), room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), perfluoropolymers, and high-performance polyimides.

abstract = "A hybrid system that combines forward osmosis with a reverse osmosis seawater desalination process could reduce both energy requirements and environmental impacts by osmotic dilution of the seawater and concentrated brine with an impaired low salinity stream, such as treated wastewater effluent. In this study, we investigate the membrane fouling behavior in forward osmosis under conditions simulating the osmotic dilution process and the use of hydrodynamic methods without the use of cleaning chemicals, to control membrane fouling. Fouling runs with seawater or \{SWRO\} brine draw solution and deionized (DI) water feed solution showed insignificant water flux decline, which implies negligible effect of particulate and organic matter in the seawater/brine on fouling of the \{FO\} membrane support layer. Fouling of the membrane active layer was evaluated by using an enriched synthetic wastewater effluent containing a mixture of inorganic and organic foulants, focusing on the impact of permeate drag force on fouling layer formation. Our results demonstrate that higher permeate water flux causes an increase in concentration build-up of foulants at the membrane surface, thereby forming a dense inorganic/organic combined fouling layer during \{FO\} fouling runs. We also examined three hydrodynamic methods for minimizing \{FO\} membrane fouling in the osmotic dilution process: (1) applying shear force on the membrane surface by increasing the cross-flow velocity, (2) using a feed-channel spacer to induce turbulence, and (3) employing pulsed flow to remove foulants from the membrane surface. Our results show that these hydrodynamic methods substantially reduce fouling and flux decline rate. "
