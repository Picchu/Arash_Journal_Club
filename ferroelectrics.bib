  abstract={Metals cannot exhibit ferroelectricity because static internal electric fields are screened by conduction electrons1, but in 1965, Anderson and Blount predicted the possibility of a ferroelectric metal, in which a ferroelectric-like structural transition occurs in the metallic state. Up to now, no clear example of such a material has been identified. Here we report on a centrosymmetric (R-3c) to non-centrosymmetric (R3c) transition in metallic LiOsO3 that is structurally equivalent to the ferroelectric transition of LiNbO3 (ref. 3). The transition involves a continuous shift in the mean position of Li+ ions on cooling below 140 K. Its discovery realizes the scenario described in ref. 2, and establishes a new class of materials whose properties may differ from those of normal metals.}

  abstract = "Freestanding BaTiO3 nanodots exhibit domain structures characterized by distinct quadrants of ferroelastic 90° domains in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. These differ significantly from flux-closure domain patterns in the same systems imaged by piezoresponse force microscopy. Based upon a series of phase field simulations of BaTiO3 nanodots, we suggest that the TEM patterns result from a radial electric field arising from electron beam charging of the nanodot. For sufficiently large charging, this converts flux-closure domain patterns to quadrant patterns with radial net polarizations. Not only does this explain the puzzling patterns that have been observed in TEM studies of ferroelectric nanodots, but also suggests how to manipulate ferroelectric domain patterns via electron beams."

  abstract = "Epitaxial growth of SrTiO3 on silicon by molecular beam epitaxy has opened up the route to the integration of functional complex oxides on a silicon platform. Chief among them is ferroelectric functionality using perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3. However, it has remained a challenge to achieve ferroelectricity in epitaxial BaTiO3 films with a polarization pointing perpendicular to the silicon substrate without a conducting bottom electrode. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in such stacks. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of crystalline domains with the long axis of the tetragonal structure oriented perpendicular to the substrate. Using piezoforce microscopy, polar domains can be written and read and are reversibly switched with a phase change of 1808. Open, saturated hysteresis loops are recorded. Thus, ferroelectric switching of 8- to 40-nm-thick BaTiO3 films in metal?ferroelectric?semiconductor structures is realized, and field-effect devices using this epitaxial oxide stack can be envisaged."

  abstract = "The miniaturization and integration of frequency-agile microwave circuits?relevant to electronically tunable filters, antennas, reso- nators and phase shifters?with microelectronics offers tantalizing device possibilities, yet requires thin films whose dielectric constant at gigahertz frequencies can be tuned by applying a quasi-static electric field1. Appropriate systems such as BaxSr12xTiO3 have a paraelectric?ferroelectric transition just below ambient temper- ature, providing high tunability. Unfortunately, such films suffer significant losses arising from defects. Recognizing that progress is stymied by dielectric loss, we start with a system with exceptionally low loss?Srn11TinO3n11 phases?in which (SrO)2 crystallographic shear planes provide an alternative to the formation of point defects for accommodating non-stoichiometry. Here we report the experimental realization of a highly tunable ground state arising from the emergence of a local ferroelectric instability in biaxially strained Srn11TinO3n11 phases with n $ 3 at frequencies up to 125 GHz. In contrast to traditional methods of modifying ferroelectrics? doping or strain?in this unique system an increase in the separation between the (SrO)2 planes, which can be achieved by changing n, bolsters the local ferroelectric instability. This new con- trol parameter, n, can be exploited to achieve a figure of merit at room temperature that rivals all known tunable microwave dielectrics."

  abstract="Persistent photoconductivity was observed in strontium titanate (SrTiO3) single crystals. When exposed to sub-bandgap light (2.9 eV or higher) at room temperature, the free-electron concentration increases by over 2 orders of magnitude. After the light is turned off, the enhanced conductivity persists for several days, with negligible decay. From positron lifetime measurements, the persistent photoconductivity is attributed to the excitation of an electron from a titanium vacancy defect into the conduction band, with a very low recapture rate."
