  abstract={Metals cannot exhibit ferroelectricity because static internal electric fields are screened by conduction electrons1, but in 1965, Anderson and Blount predicted the possibility of a ferroelectric metal, in which a ferroelectric-like structural transition occurs in the metallic state. Up to now, no clear example of such a material has been identified. Here we report on a centrosymmetric (R-3c) to non-centrosymmetric (R3c) transition in metallic LiOsO3 that is structurally equivalent to the ferroelectric transition of LiNbO3 (ref. 3). The transition involves a continuous shift in the mean position of Li+ ions on cooling below 140â€‰K. Its discovery realizes the scenario described in ref. 2, and establishes a new class of materials whose properties may differ from those of normal metals.}

  abstract = "Freestanding BaTiO3 nanodots exhibit domain structures characterized by distinct quadrants of ferroelastic 90Â° domains in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. These differ significantly from flux-closure domain patterns in the same systems imaged by piezoresponse force microscopy. Based upon a series of phase field simulations of BaTiO3 nanodots, we suggest that the TEM patterns result from a radial electric field arising from electron beam charging of the nanodot. For sufficiently large charging, this converts flux-closure domain patterns to quadrant patterns with radial net polarizations. Not only does this explain the puzzling patterns that have been observed in TEM studies of ferroelectric nanodots, but also suggests how to manipulate ferroelectric domain patterns via electron beams."

  abstract = "Epitaxial growth of SrTiO3 on silicon by molecular beam epitaxy has opened up the route to the integration of functional complex oxides on a silicon platform. Chief among them is ferroelectric functionality using perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3. However, it has remained a challenge to achieve ferroelectricity in epitaxial BaTiO3 films with a polarization pointing perpendicular to the silicon substrate without a conducting bottom electrode. Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in such stacks. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of crystalline domains with the long axis of the tetragonal structure oriented perpendicular to the substrate. Using piezoforce microscopy, polar domains can be written and read and are reversibly switched with a phase change of 1808. Open, saturated hysteresis loops are recorded. Thus, ferroelectric switching of 8- to 40-nm-thick BaTiO3 films in metal?ferroelectric?semiconductor structures is realized, and field-effect devices using this epitaxial oxide stack can be envisaged."

Appropriate systems such as BaxSr12xTiO3 have a paraelectric?ferroelectric transition just below ambient temper- ature, providing high tunability. Unfortunately, such films suffer significant losses arising from defects. Recognizing that progress is stymied by dielectric loss, we start with a system with exceptionally low loss?Srn11TinO3n11 phases?in which (SrO)2 crystallographic shear planes provide an alternative to the formation of point defects for accommodating non-stoichiometry. Here we report the experimental realization of a highly tunable ground state arising from the emergence of a local ferroelectric instability in biaxially strained Srn11TinO3n11 phases with n $ 3 at frequencies up to 125 GHz. In contrast to traditional methods of modifying ferroelectrics? doping or strain?in this unique system an increase in the separation between the (SrO)2 planes, which can be achieved by changing n, bolsters the local ferroelectric instability. This new con- trol parameter, n, can be exploited to achieve a figure of merit at room temperature that rivals all known tunable microwave dielectrics."

When exposed to sub-bandgap light (2.9 eV or higher) at room temperature, the free-electron concentration increases by over 2 orders of magnitude. After the light is turned off, the enhanced conductivity persists for several days, with negligible decay. From positron lifetime measurements, the persistent photoconductivity is attributed to the excitation of an electron from a titanium vacancy defect into the conduction band, with a very low recapture rate."

  abstract = "Oxygen vacancies are an important type of defect in transition metal oxides. In SrTiO3 they are believed to be the main donors in an otherwise intrinsic crystal. At the same time, a relatively deep gap state associated with the vacancy is widely reported. To explain this inconsistency we investigate the effect of electron correlation in an oxygen vacancy (OV) in SrTiO3. When taking correlation into account, we find that the OV-induced localized level can at most trap one electron, while the second electron occupies the conduction band. Our results offer a natural explanation of how the OV in SrTiO3 can produce a deep in-gap level (about 1 eV below the conduction band bottom) in photoemission, and at the same time be an electron donor. Our analysis implies that an OV in SrTiO3 should be fundamentally regarded as a magnetic impurity, whose deep level is always partially occupied due to the strong Coulomb repulsion. An OV-based Anderson impurity model is derived, and its implications are discussed."

  Transport and other measurements in this system show a plethora of diverse physical phenomena.
  To better understand the interface conductivity, we used scanning superconducting quantum 
  interference device microscopy to image the magnetic field locally generated by current in an 
  interface. At low temperature, we found that the current flowed in conductive narrow paths 
  oriented along the crystallographic axes, embedded in a less conductive background. The 
  configuration of these paths changed on thermal cycling above the STO cubic-to-tetragonal 
  structural transition temperature, implying that the local conductivity is strongly modified

  provides an additional mechanism for understanding and controlling the behaviour of heterostructures.}

  of the most celebrated substratesâ€”strontium titanate (SrTiO3). This material hosts a 
  range of phenomena, including ferroelasticity, incipient ferroelectricity, and most 
  puzzlingly, contested giant piezoelectricity. Although these properties may markedly 
  influence the oxide interfaces, especially on microscopic length scales, the lack of 
  local probes capable of studying such buried systems has left their effects largely 
  unexplored. Here we use a scanning charge detectorâ€”a nanotube single-electron

  response in the prototypical LaAlO3/SrTiO3 system with unprecedented sensitivity. 
  Our measurements reveal that on microscopic scales SrTiO3 exhibits large anomalous 
  piezoelectricity with curious spatial dependence. Through electrostatic imaging we 
  unravel the microscopic origin for this extrinsic piezoelectricity, demonstrating 
  its direct, quantitative connection to the motion of locally ordered tetragonal 
  domains under applied gate voltage. These domains create striped potential modulations 
  that can markedly influence the two-dimensional electron system at the conducting

  abstract = "Resonant piezoelectric spectroscopy shows polar resonances in paraelectric SrTiO3 at temperatures below 80 K. These resonances become strong at T < 40 K. The resonances are induced by weak electric fields and lead to standing mechanical waves in the sample. This piezoelectric response does not exist in paraelastic SrTiO3 nor at temperatures just below the ferroelastic phase transition. The interpretation of the resonances is related to ferroelastic twin walls which become polar at low temperatures in close analogy with the known behavior of CaTiO3. SrTiO3 is different from CaTiO3, however, because the wall polarity is thermally induced; i.e., there exists a small temperature range well below the ferroelastic transition point at 105 K where polarity appears on cooling. As the walls are atomistically thin, this transition has the hallmarks of a two-dimensional phase transition restrained to the twin boundaries rather than a classic bulk phase transition."

Exchange and magnetostatic interactions within ferromagnetic films oppose the formation of such domains. Using micromagnetic simulations and a one-dimensional model, we demonstrate that competing energies lead to the breakdown of domain pattern transfer below a critical domain size. Moreover, rotation of the magnetic field results in abrupt transitions between two scaling regimes with different magnetic anisotropy. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by experiments on CoFeB/BaTiO3heterostructures."

The effect can be viewed as a two-step process: Switching the polarization first results in the change of the sense of the rotation of the oxygen octahedra, which in turn induces the switching of the secondary magnetic order parameter. The first step is governed by an original trilinear-coupling energy between polarization, octahedral tilting, and an antiferroelectric distortion. The second step is controlled by another trilinear coupling, this one involving the predominant and secondary magnetic orders as well as the oxygen octahedral tilting. In contrast with other trilinear-coupling effects in the literature, the present ones occur in a simple ABO3 perovskite and involve a large polarization."

The magnitude of the bias E field can be controlled by varying the magnitude of H, and its sign can be reversed by changing the sign of H or the relative clamping direction between P and M.

We show that BiMnO3 displays under pressure a rich sequence of five phases with a great variety of structures and properties, including a metallic phase above 53 GPa and, between 37 and 53 GPa, a strongly elongated monoclinic phase that allows ferroelectricity, which contradicts the traditional expectation that ferroelectricity vanishes under pressure.
