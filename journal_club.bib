  abstract = "The miniaturization of electronic devices has been the principal driving force behind the semiconductor industry, and has brought about major improvements in computational power and energy efficiency. Although advances with silicon-based electronics continue to be made, alternative technologies are being explored. Digital cir- cuits based on transistors fabricated from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential to outperform silicon by improving the energy? delay product, a metric of energy efficiency, by more than an order of magnitude. Hence, CNTs are an exciting complement to existing semiconductor technologies. Owing to substantial fundamental imperfections inherent in CNTs, however, only very basic circuit blocks have been demonstrated. Here we show how these imperfec- tions can be overcome, and demonstrate the first computer built entirely using CNT-based transistors. The CNT computer runs an operating system that is capable of multitasking: as a demonstra- tion, we perform counting and integer-sorting simultaneously. In addition, we implement 20 different instructions from the commer- cial MIPS instruction set to demonstrate the generality of our CNT computer. This experimental demonstration is the most complex carbon-based electronic system yet realized. It is a considerable advance because CNTs are prominent among a variety of emerging technologies that are being considered for the next generation of highly energy-efficient electronic systems."

  abstract = "Spin-orbit interaction provides a spin filtering effect in carbon nanotube based Cooper pair splitters that allows us to determine spin correlators directly from current measurements. The spin filtering axes are tunable by a global external magnetic field. By a bending of the nanotube, the filtering axes on both sides of the Cooper pair splitter become sufficiently different that a test of entanglement of the injected Cooper pairs through a Bell-like inequality can be implemented. This implementation does not require noise measurements, supports imperfect splitting efficiency and disorder, and does not demand a full knowledge of the spin-orbit strength. Using a microscopic calculation we demonstrate that entanglement detection by violation of the Bell-like inequality is within the reach of current experimental setups."

The extracted energy level spectrum, overall consistent with negligible disorder in the nanotube, shows in the half filled case large renormalizations due to Coulombian effects."

  abstract = "Carbon nanotubes exhibit a wealth of unique physical proper- ties. By virtue of their exceptionally low mass and extreme stiff- ness they provide ultrahigh-quality mechanical resonances, promise long electron spin coherence times in a nuclear-spin free lattice for quantum information processing and spintronics, and feature unprecedented tunability of optical transitions for optoelectronic applications. Excitons in semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes could facilitate the upconversion of spin, mechanical or hybrid spin?mechanical degrees of freedom to optical frequencies for efficient manipulation and detection. However, successful implementation of such schemes with carbon nanotubes has been impeded by rapid exciton decoherence at non-radiative quenching sites, environmental dephasing and emission intermittence. Here we demonstrate that these limitations may be overcome by exciton localization in suspended carbon nanotubes. For excitons localized in nanotube quantum dots we found narrow optical lines free of spectral wandering, radiative exciton lifetimes and effectively suppressed blinking. Our findings identify the great potential of localized excitons for efficient and spectrally precise interfacing of photons, phonons and spins in novel carbon nanotube-based quantum devices."

  abstract = "Among the remarkable variety of semiconducting nanomaterials that have been discovered over the past two decades, single-walled carbon nanotubes remain uniquely well suited for applications in high-performance electronics, sensors and other technologies. The most advanced opportunities demand the ability to form perfectly aligned, horizontal arrays of purely semiconducting, chemically pristine carbon nanotubes. Here, we present strategies that offer this capability. Nanoscale thermocapillary flows in thin-film organic coatings followed by reactive ion etching serve as highly efficient means for selectively removing metallic carbon nanotubes from electronically heterogeneous aligned arrays grown on quartz substrates. The low temperatures and unusual physics associated with this process enable robust, scalable operation, with clear potential for practical use. We carry out detailed experimental and theoretical studies to reveal all of the essential attributes of the underlying thermophysical phenomena. We demonstrate use of the purified arrays in transistors that achieve mobilities exceeding 1,000 cm2 V21 s21 and on/off switching ratios of ?10,000 with current outputs in the milliamp range. Simple logic gates built using such devices represent the first steps toward integration into more complex circuits."

  abstract = "Although electron spins in III?V semiconductor quantum dots have shown great promise as qubits, hyperfine decoherence remains a major challenge in these materials. Group IV semi- conductors possess dominant nuclear species that are spinless, allowing qubit coherence times up to 2 s. In carbon nano- tubes, where the spin?orbit interaction allows for all-electrical qubit manipulation, theoretical predictions of the coherence time vary by at least six orders of magnitude and range up to 10 s or more. Here, we realize a qubit encoded in two nanotube valley?spin states, with coherent manipulation via electrically driven spin resonance mediated by a bend in the nanotube. Readout uses Pauli blockade leakage current through a double quantum dot13?15. Arbitrary qubit rotations are demonstrated and the coherence time is measured for the first time via Hahn echo, allowing comparison with theoretical predictions. The coherence time is found to be ?65 ns, prob- ably limited by electrical noise. This shows that, even with low nuclear spin abundance, coherence can be strongly degraded if the qubit states are coupled to electric fields."

To understand the origin of the new PL peaks, we study theoretically the excited-state properties of SWCNTs with some typical dopants and defects by ab initio many-body perturbation theory. Our calculations demonstrate that the Stokes shift in doped centers can be as large as 170 meV, which is much larger than that of intact SWCNTs and must be taken into account. We find dipole-allowed transitions from localized midgap and shallow impurity levels, which can give rise to pronounced PL peaks. Dark excitons, on the other hand, seem to have oscillator strengths that are too small to account for the new PL peaks."

We measure the absolute absorption cross section of a wide range of semiconducting nanotubes at their S22 transition and show that it varies by up to a factor of 2.2 with the chiral angle, with type I nanotubes showing a larger absorption.

  abstract = "The ability to tune local parameters of quantum Hamiltonians has been demonstrated in experimental systems including ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting circuits and photonic crystals. Such systems possess negligible disorder, enabling local tunability. Conversely, in condensed-matter systems, electrons are subject to disorder, which often destroys delicate correlated phases and precludes local tunability. The realization of a disorder-free and locally-tunable condensed- matter system thus remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate a new technique for deterministic creation of locally-tunable, ultralow-disorder electron systems in carbon nanotubes suspended over complex electronic circuits. Using transport experiments we show that electrons can be localized at any position along the nanotube and that the confinement potential can be smoothly moved from location to location. The high mirror symmetry of transport characteristics about the nanotube centre establishes the negligible effects of electronic disorder, thus allowing experiments in precision-engineered one-dimensional potentials. We further demonstrate the ability to position multiple nanotubes at chosen separations, generaliz- ing these devices to coupled one-dimensional systems. These capabilities could enable many novel experiments on electronics, mechanics and spins in one dimension."

In particular, the nanotubes can carry a substantial amount of cargo (100 times more than a monoclonal antibody), but can still be rapidly eliminated from the circulation by renal filtration, like a small molecule, due to their high aspect ratio. Here we show that SWNTs can target tumours in a two-step approach in which nanotubes modified with morpholino oligonucleotide sequences bind to cancer cells that have been pretargeted with antibodies modified with oligonucleotide strands complementary to those on the nanotubes. The nanotubes can carry fluorophores or radioisotopes, and are shown to selectively bind to cancer cells in vitro and in tumour-bearing xenografted mice. The binding process is also found to lead to antigen capping and internalization of the antibody?nanotube complexes. The nanotube conjugates were labelled with both alpha-particle and gamma-ray emitting isotopes, at high specific activities. Conjugates labelled with alpha-particle-generating 225Ac were found to clear rapidly, thus mitigating radioisotope toxicity, and were shown to be therapeutically effective in vivo."

In this study, we investigate the membrane fouling behavior in forward osmosis under conditions simulating the osmotic dilution process and the use of hydrodynamic methods without the use of cleaning chemicals, to control membrane fouling. Fouling runs with seawater or \{SWRO\} brine draw solution and deionized (DI) water feed solution showed insignificant water flux decline, which implies negligible effect of particulate and organic matter in the seawater/brine on fouling of the \{FO\} membrane support layer. Fouling of the membrane active layer was evaluated by using an enriched synthetic wastewater effluent containing a mixture of inorganic and organic foulants, focusing on the impact of permeate drag force on fouling layer formation. Our results demonstrate that higher permeate water flux causes an increase in concentration build-up of foulants at the membrane surface, thereby forming a dense inorganic/organic combined fouling layer during \{FO\} fouling runs. We also examined three hydrodynamic methods for minimizing \{FO\} membrane fouling in the osmotic dilution process: (1) applying shear force on the membrane surface by increasing the cross-flow velocity, (2) using a feed-channel spacer to induce turbulence, and (3) employing pulsed flow to remove foulants from the membrane surface. Our results show that these hydrodynamic methods substantially reduce fouling and flux decline rate. "

Not only does this explain the puzzling patterns that have been observed in TEM studies of ferroelectric nanodots, but also suggests how to manipulate ferroelectric domain patterns via electron beams."

Here, we demonstrate ferroelectricity in such stacks. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal the presence of crystalline domains with the long axis of the tetragonal structure oriented perpendicular to the substrate. Using piezoforce microscopy, polar domains can be written and read and are reversibly switched with a phase change of 1808. Open, saturated hysteresis loops are recorded. Thus, ferroelectric switching of 8- to 40-nm-thick BaTiO3 films in metal?ferroelectric?semiconductor structures is realized, and field-effect devices using this epitaxial oxide stack can be envisaged."

Appropriate systems such as BaxSr12xTiO3 have a paraelectric?ferroelectric transition just below ambient temper- ature, providing high tunability.

  abstract = "The discovery of quasicrystals1?crystalline structures that show order while lacking periodicity?forced a paradigm shift in crystal- lography. Initially limited to intermetallic systems, the observa- tion of quasicrystalline structures has recently expanded to include ?soft? quasicrystals in the fields of colloidal and supermolecular chemistry. Here we report an aperiodic oxide that grows as a two- dimensional quasicrystal on a periodic single-element substrate. On a Pt(111) substrate with 3-fold symmetry, the perovskite barium titanate BaTiO3 forms a high-temperature interface-driven struc- ture with 12-fold symmetry. The building blocks of this dodecagonal structure assemble with the theoretically predicted Stampfli?Ga?hler tiling having a fundamental length-scale of 0.69 nm. This example of interface-driven formation of ultrathin quasicrystals from a typical periodic perovskite oxide potentially extends the quasicrystal concept to a broader range of materials. In addition, it demonstrates that frustration at the interface between two periodic materials can drive a thin film into an aperiodic quasicrystalline phase, as proposed previously. Such structures might also find use as ultrathin buffer layers for the accommodation of large lattice mismatches in con- ventional epitaxy."

abstract = "An algorithm is presented for carrying out decomposition of electronic charge density into atomic contributions. As suggested by Bader [R. Bader, Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990], space is divided up into atomic regions where the dividing surfaces are at a minimum in the charge density, i.e. the gradient of the charge density is zero along the surface normal. Instead of explicitly finding and representing the dividing surfaces, which is a challenging task, our algorithm assigns each point on a regular (x,&#xa0;y,&#xa0;z) grid to one of the regions by following a steepest ascent path on the grid. The computational work required to analyze a given charge density grid is approximately 50 arithmetic operations per grid point. The work scales linearly with the number of grid points and is essentially independent of the number of atoms in the system. The algorithm is robust and insensitive to the topology of molecular bonding. In addition to two test problems involving a water molecule and NaCl crystal, the algorithm has been used to estimate the electrical activity of a cluster of boron atoms in a silicon crystal. The highly stable three-atom boron cluster, \{B3I\} is found to have a charge of âˆ’1.5&#xa0;e, which suggests approximately 50\% reduction in electrical activity as compared with three substitutional boron atoms.

  abstract="We report the assembly of magic number C60m-Aun complexes on the Au(111) surface. These complexes have a unique structure consisting of a single atomic layer Au island wrapped by a self-selected number (seven, ten, or twelve) of C60 molecules. The smallest structure consisting of 7 C60 molecules and 19 Au atoms, stable up to 400 K, has a preferred orientation on the surface. We propose a globalized metal-organic coordination mechanism for the stability of the C60m-Aun complexes."

  abstract="The development of personalized medicine?in which medical treatment is customized to an individual on the basis of genetic information?requires techniques that can sequence DNA quickly and cheaply. Single-molecule sequencing technologies, such as nanopores, can potentially be used to sequence long strands of DNA without labels or amplification, but a viable technique has yet to be established. Here, we show that single DNA molecules can be sequenced by monitoring the electrical conductance of a phi29 DNA polymerase as it incorporates unlabelled nucleotides into a template strand of DNA. The conductance of the polymerase is measured by attaching it to a protein transistor that consists of an antibody molecule (immunoglobulin G) bound to two gold nanoparticles, which are in turn connected to source and drain electrodes. The electrical conductance of the DNA polymerase exhibits well-separated plateaux that are ?3 pA in height. Each plateau corresponds to an individual base and is formed at a rate of ?22 nucleotides per second. Additional spikes appear on top of the plateaux and can be used to discriminate between the four different nucleotides. We also show that the sequencing platform works with a variety of DNA polymerases and can sequence difficult templates such as homopolymers."
