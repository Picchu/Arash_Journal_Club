	Abstract = {"In this Letter we highlight direct experimental evidence of Fe2þ-Fe3þ charge ordering at room temperature in hematite-ilmenite Fe1:35Ti0:65O3 epitaxial thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled to high-resolution energy electron-loss spectroscopy. These advanced spectromicroscopy techniques demonstrate a strong modu- lation of the Fe2þ valence state along the c axis. Density functional theory calculations provide crucial information on the key role of oxygen vacancies in the observed charge distributions. Their presence at significant levels leads to the localization of extra electrons onto reduced Fe2þ sites, while Ti remains solely þ4. The magnetic and transport properties of these films are reviewed in the light of the present results regarding their ferrimagnetic character correlated with the Fe2þ modulation and their semi- conducting behavior interpreted by an Efros-Shklovskii variable-range hopping conduction regime via Fe2þ and Fe3þ centers. The experimental evidence of only one type of mixed valence state, i.e., Fe2þ and Fe3þ , in the Fe2x Tix O3 system will thus help to interpret further the origin of its geomagnetic properties and to illuminate fundamental issues regarding its spintronic potential."

@article{wang2013anisotropic,
	Abstract = {Two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at a oxide heterostructures are attracting considerable attention, as these might substitute conventional semiconductors for novel electronic de??????????????????vices. Here we present a minimal set-up for such a 2DEG ? the SrTiO3 (110)-(4 × 1) sur-face, natively terminated with one monolayer of chemically-inert titania. Oxygen vacancies induced by synchrotron radiation migrate underneath this overlayer, this leads to a confining po- tential and electron doping such that a 2DEG de- velops. Our angular resolved photoemission spec- troscopy (ARPES) and theoretical results show that confinement along (110) is strikingly differ- ent from a (001) crystal orientation. In particular the quantized subbands show a surprising ?semi-heavy? band, in contrast to the analogue in the bulk, and a high electronic anisotropy. This anisotropy and even the effective mass of the (110) 2DEG is tunable by doping, offering a high flexibility to engineer the properties of this system.},
