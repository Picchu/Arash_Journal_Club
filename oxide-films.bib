	Abstract = {"In this Letter we highlight direct experimental evidence of Fe2Ã¾-Fe3Ã¾ charge ordering at room temperature in hematite-ilmenite Fe1:35Ti0:65O3 epitaxial thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition, using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled to high-resolution energy electron-loss spectroscopy. These advanced spectromicroscopy techniques demonstrate a strong modu- lation of the Fe2Ã¾ valence state along the c axis. Density functional theory calculations provide crucial information on the key role of oxygen vacancies in the observed charge distributions. Their presence at significant levels leads to the localization of extra electrons onto reduced Fe2Ã¾ sites, while Ti remains solely Ã¾4. The magnetic and transport properties of these films are reviewed in the light of the present results regarding their ferrimagnetic character correlated with the Fe2Ã¾ modulation and their semi- conducting behavior interpreted by an Efros-Shklovskii variable-range hopping conduction regime via Fe2Ã¾ and Fe3Ã¾ centers. The experimental evidence of only one type of mixed valence state, i.e., Fe2Ã¾ and Fe3Ã¾ , in the Fe2x Tix O3 system will thus help to interpret further the origin of its geomagnetic properties and to illuminate fundamental issues regarding its spintronic potential."

	Abstract = {Two dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at a oxide heterostructures are attracting considerable attention, as these might substitute conventional semiconductors for novel electronic devices. Here we present a minimal set-up for such a 2DEG the SrTiO3 (110)-(4 Ã— 1) surface, natively terminated with one monolayer of chemically-inert titania. Oxygen vacancies induced by synchrotron radiation migrate underneath this overlayer, this leads to a confining potential and electron doping such that a 2DEG develops. Our angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and theoretical results show that confinement along (110) is strikingly different from a (001) crystal orientation. In particular the quantized subbands show a surprising semi-heavy band, in contrast to the analogue in the bulk, and a high electronic anisotropy. This anisotropy and even the effective mass of the (110) 2DEG is tunable by doping, offering a high flexibility to engineer the properties of this system.},

  abstract = "Finite-temperature properties of epitaxial films made of BaðZr;TiÞO3 relaxor ferroelectrics are determined as a function of misfit strain, via the use of a first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian. These films are macroscopically paraelectric at any temperature, for any strain ranging between -3\% and +3\%. However, original temperature-versus-misfit strain phase diagrams are obtained for the Burns temperature (Tb) and for the critical temperatures (Tm,z and Tm,IP) at which the out-of-plane and in-plane dielectric response peak, respectively, which allow the identification of three different regions. These latter differ from their evolution of Tb, Tm,z, and/or Tm,IP with strain, which are the fingerprints of a remarkable strain-induced microscopic change: each of these regions is associated with its own characteristic behavior of polar nanoregions at low temperature, such as strain-induced rotation or strain-driven elongation of their dipoles or even increase in the average size of the polar nanoregions when the strength of the strain grows."

  abstract = "A bimodal size distribution of two-dimensional islands is inferred during interface formation in heteroepitaxial growth of bismuth ferrite on (001) oriented SrTiO3 by sputter deposition. Features observed by in situ x-ray scattering are explained by a model where coalescence of islands determines the growth kinetics with negligible surface diffusion on SrTiO3. Small clusters maintain a compact shape as they coalesce, while clusters beyond a critical size impinge to form large irregular connected islands and a population of smaller clusters forms in the spaces between the larger ones."

  abstract = "The origin of ferromagnetism in strained epitaxial LaCoO3 films has been a long-standing mystery. Here, we combine atomically resolved Z-contrast imaging, electron-energy-loss spectroscopy, and density- functional calculations to demonstrate that, in epitaxial LaCoO3 films, oxygen-vacancy superstructures release strain, control the film?s electronic properties, and produce the observed ferromagnetism via the excess electrons in the Co d states. Although oxygen vacancies typically dope a material n-type, we find that ordered vacancies induce Peierls-like minigaps which, combined with strain relaxation, trigger a nonlinear rupture of the energy bands, resulting in insulating behavior."
